CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In the offered system, Computer Vision used to detect and measure objects. The system can detect and measure objects in a real time video. After the object has been detected by using canny edge detector, the size is obtained for each object by using OpenCV functions. We enhanced the canny edge detector algorithm through utilizing Morphological operations. This procedure benefits to eliminate extra noises. Furthermore, whereas eliminating the extra noises it likewise smoothens the shape and keeps the outline and size of each object. Thus, the outlines of the different objects in the scene were kept. OpenCV is a powerful library that provides a wide range of tools and functions for object measurement in images. The library provides various functions for image preprocessing, object detection and segmentation, and object measurement, making it an ideal choice for tasks such as object recognition, counting, and tracking. Overall, OpenCV is a versatile and flexible library that provides a wide range of tools for object measurement in images. Its ease of use, wide range of functions, and support for deep learning make it an essential tool for researchers, developers, and engineers working
