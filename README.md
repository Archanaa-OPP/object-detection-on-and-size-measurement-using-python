# object-detection-on-and-size-measurement-using-python
This project presents an enhanced technique for detecting objects and computing their measurements in real time from video streams. We suggested an object measurement technique for uploading image by utilizing OpenCV libraries and includes the canny edge detection, dilation, and erosion algorithms.
