# object-detection-on-and-size-measurement-using-python
This project presents an enhanced technique for detecting objects and computing their measurements in real time from video streams. We suggested an object measurement technique for uploading image by utilizing OpenCV libraries and includes the canny edge detection, dilation, and erosion algorithms.
Title: Object Detection and Measurement Using OpenCV and Python.

 Requirements: 
 1. python          (3.7.3)
 2. opencv          (4.1.0)
 3. numpy           (1.61.4)
 4. imutils         (0.5.2)

To RUN:
1. Open Anaconda prompt

2. Set the path of file directory saved.

3. Commands to run the detection and measurement:
 
	python object_size_mine.py --image images/im0.png --width 0.955.

4. It will open a dialog window to detect and measure the object height and width.

5. How many objects in that input image and how many objects detected on that image was print in prompt.
