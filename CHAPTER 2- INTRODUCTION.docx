INTRODUCTION
The competence of the proposed system has been confirmed through utilizing in image dataset. The execution of this procedure has a high computation rate and it is dependent on the resolution of frames. The achievement of identifying objects and separate these objects from the background is perfect. To calculate the size of each object, firstly we need to determine the reference object. After that, the dimensions of the reference objects will be used to calculate the size of other objects. The reference object always is the left-most object in the image. Also, to calibrate your pixels per metric variable, the reference object can be utilized and from there, calculate the size of other objects in all frames. Every processes utilize the libraries of OpenCV. We have found various papers attached to a measurement system. Each measurement applications are utilized for various purposes. A movable outdoor distance measurement system was proposed and 90% precision were obtained. The distance was measured by utilizing through utilizing OpenCV. For this purpose, a temperature reparation module was used to improve the accuracy. An ultrasonic distance measurement system was proposed for embedding distance measurement. The sizes of objects in an image are estimated by using computer vision methods. Object detection and measurement are two important tasks in computer vision and image processing.
Object detection refers to the process of locating and classifying objects within an image or a video stream. It involves analysing the pixels in an image to determine whether there are any objects of interest present and, if so, where they are located and what they are. Object detection can be done using various algorithms, such as Haar cascades, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and deep learning-based approaches like Faster R-CNN, YOLO (You Only Look Once), and SSD (Single Shot Detector).
On the other hand, object measurement involves determining the size, shape, and orientation of objects within an image or a video stream. Object measurement is often used in industrial and manufacturing applications to ensure that products meet certain size or quality standards. It can be done using various techniques, such as template matching, edge detection, and contour analysis.
Both object detection and measurement are important in a wide range of fields, including robotics, surveillance, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and more. By accurately detecting and measuring objects in images and videos, it is possible to extract valuable information and insights that can be used to make informed decisions and take actions.

2.1.	ARTIFICIAL INTELLINGENCE:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn. It is also a field of study which tries to make computers "smart". As machines become increasingly capable, mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. AI is an area of computer sciences that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and reacts like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include: Face recognition, Learning, Planning, Decision making etc.
Artificial intelligence is the use of computer science programming to imitate human thought and action by analysing data and surroundings, solving or anticipating problems and learning or self-teaching to adapt to a variety of tasks.

2.2.	MACHINE LEARNING
Machine learning is a growing technology which enables computers to learn automatically from past data. Machine learning uses various algorithms for building mathematical models and making predictions using historical data or information. Currently, it is being used for various tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, email filtering, Facebook auto-tagging, recommender system, and many more.
Machine Learning is said as a subset of artificial intelligence that is mainly concerned with the development of algorithms which allow a computer to learn from the data and past experiences on their own. The term machine learning was first introduced by Arthur Samuel in 1959. We can define it in a summarized way as: “Machine learning enables a machine to automatically learn from data, improve performance from experiences, and predict things without being explicitly programmed”.
A Machine Learning system learns from historical data, builds the prediction models, and whenever it receives new data, predicts the output for it. The accuracy of predicted output depends upon the amount of data, as the huge amount of data helps to build a better model which predicts the output more accurately.
Suppose we have a complex problem, where we need to perform some predictions, so instead of writing a code for it, we just need to feed the data to generic algorithms, and with the help of these algorithms, machine builds the logic as per the data and predict the output. Machine learning has changed our way of thinking about the problem. The below block diagram explains the working of Machine Learning algorithm:

 
2.2.1.	Features of Machine Learning:
•	Machine learning uses data to detect various patterns in a given dataset.
•	It can learn from past data and improve automatically.
•	It is a data-driven technology.
•	Machine learning is much similar to data mining as it also deals with the huge amount of the data.
2.2.2.	Classification of Machine Learning
At a broad level, machine learning can be classified into three types:
1.	Supervised learning
2.	Unsupervised learning
3.	Reinforcement learning
1) Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning method in which we provide sample labelled data to the machine learning system in order to train it, and on that basis, it predicts the output.
The system creates a model using labelled data to understand the datasets and learn about each data, once the training and processing are done then we test the model by providing a sample data to check whether it is predicting the exact output or not.
The goal of supervised learning is to map input data with the output data. The supervised learning is based on supervision, and it is the same as when a student learns things in the supervision of the teacher. The example of supervised learning is spam filtering.



Supervised learning can be grouped further in two categories of algorithms:

•	Classification
•	Regression

2) Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a learning method in which a machine learns without any supervision. The training is provided to the machine with the set of data that has not been labeled, classified, or categorized, and the algorithm needs to act on that data without any supervision. The goal of unsupervised learning is to restructure the input data into new features or a group of objects with similar patterns.
In unsupervised learning, we don't have a predetermined result. The machine tries to find useful insights from the huge amount of data. 
It can be further classifieds into two categories of algorithms:
•	Clustering
•	Association


3)	Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on developing algorithms and models that allow agents to learn how to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward. In other words, reinforcement learning involves teaching an agent to learn through trial and error, by receiving feedback in the form of a reward or punishment for each action taken.
The basic idea behind reinforcement learning is to have an agent interact with an environment, take actions based on the current state of the environment, and receive feedback in the form of a reward or punishment. The goal of the agent is to learn a policy, which is a mapping from states to actions,  that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.
Reinforcement learning is widely used in many areas, such as robotics, game playing, recommendation systems, and more. Some popular algorithms in reinforcement learning include Q-learning, policy gradient methods, actor-critic methods, and deep reinforcement learning, which combines deep neural networks with reinforcement learning to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces.
2.3	OpenCV:
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is an open-source library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. It was originally developed by Intel and is now maintained by the OpenCV Foundation. OpenCV is written in C++, but it also has bindings for other languages, including Python and Java.
OpenCV provides a wide range of functions for image and video processing, including image filtering, edge detection, feature detection, object detection, face recognition, motion analysis, camera calibration, and more. It also includes a number of machine learning algorithms that can be used for tasks such as image classification, object tracking, and clustering.
OpenCV is widely used in various fields, including robotics, surveillance, medical imaging, augmented reality, and more. It has a large and active community of users and developers, and is supported on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS. With its powerful features and ease of use, OpenCV is a popular choice for many computer vision and image processing applications.

[1] Title:  Information Measure Computation and its Impact in MI COCO Dataset

Authors: Sharma, D. K. (2021, March).
Description: 
Classification of images is an essential task that seeks to interpret up an entire picture overall. By attaching it to a particular label, the purpose is to identify the image. Image Classification usually refers to images where only a certain individual considers and is examined. On the other hand, object identification requires either classification and implementation tasks and is used to examine more practical instances in which an image may well have several objects. This study investigates the information measure to classify images that use deep learning and machine learning methods. As a computer language, Python is used since it comes with the Creators additionally. The input data primarily focuses on the group images in which four different styles of images have been included in this article. Shannon's information measure was chosen as the training phase best choice as it generated a high accuracy rate. In terms of the accuracy of the classification tasks in percentage, findings are discussed. One of them about 90.67 percent, so the same goes for another form of where second up to 90 percent and beyond is the average result.

[2] Title:  Real-time object detection for visually challenged people

Authors: Vaidya, S., Shah, N., Shah, N., & Shankarmani, R. (2020, May).
Description:
One of the most important senses for a living is vision. Millions of people living in this world deal with visual impairment. These people encounter difficulties in navigating independently and safely, facing issues in accessing information and communication. The objective of the proposed work is to change the visual world into an audio world by notifying the blind people about the objects in their path. This will help visually impaired people to navigate independently without any external assistance just by using the real-time object detection system. The application uses image processing and machine learning techniques to determine real-time objects through the camera and inform blind people about the object and its location through the audio output. Inability to differentiate between objects has led to many limitations to the existing approach which includes less accuracy and low performance results. The main objective of the proposed work is to provide good accuracy, best performance results and a viable option for the visually impaired people to make the world a better place for them.

[3] Title:  Scalable object detection, tracking and pattern recognition model using edge
computing.

Authors: Pudasaini, D., & Abhari, A. (2020, May). 
Description:
The Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as sensors and video cameras have small memories and less computational power. The video analytics of traditional approaches for detection, tracking and pattern recognition of moving objects used only in the cloud. This approach suffered from high latency and more network bandwidth to transfer data into the cloud. We address this problem by using edge computing devices between IoT devices and the cloud. We propose a new framework for scalable object detection, tracking and pattern recognition of moving objects that relies on dimensionality reduction with edge computing architecture. We also propose a scalable object detection and tracking method based on You Only Look Once (YOLO) method. The experiment demonstrates that our proposed method will save network bandwidth and processing time. The performance of object detection and tracking model is greater than 96%. This shows that our method has greater performance than existing models.

[5] Title:  Social distancing detection with deep learning model. 

Authors: Hou, Y. C., Baharuddin, M. Z., Yussof, S., & Dzulkifly, S. (2020, August).

Description:
The paper presents a methodology for social distancing detection using deep learning to evaluate the distance between people to mitigate the impact of this coronavirus pandemic. The detection tool was developed to alert people to maintain a safe distance with each other by evaluating a video feed. The video frame from the camera was used as input, and the open-source object detection pre-trained model based on the YOLOv3 algorithm was employed for pedestrian detection. Later, the video frame was transformed into top-down view for distance measurement from the 2D plane. The distance between people can be estimated and any noncompliant pair of people in the display will be indicated with a red frame and red line. The proposed method was validated on a pre-recorded video of pedestrians walking on the street. The result shows that the proposed method is able to determine the social distancing measures between multiple people in the video. The developed technique can be further developed as a detection tool in realtime application.
