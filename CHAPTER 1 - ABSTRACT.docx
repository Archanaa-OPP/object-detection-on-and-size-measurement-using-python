In these days, real-time object detection and dimensioning of objects is an important issue from many areas of industry. This is a vital topic of computer vision problems. This project presents an enhanced technique for detecting objects and computing their measurements in real time from video streams. We suggested an object measurement technique for uploading image by utilizing OpenCV libraries and includes the canny edge detection, dilation, and erosion algorithms. The suggested technique comprises of four stages: (1) identifying an object to be measured by using canny edge detection algorithm, (2) using morphological operators includes dilation and erosion algorithm to close gaps between edges, (3) find and sort contours, (4) measuring the dimensions of objects. In the implementation of the proposed technique, we designed a system that used OpenCV software library, Web cam. The proposed technique was nearly achieved 98% success in determines the size of the objects.
